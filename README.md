# Plant-Disease-Classification-in-Potatoes

Synopsis:
Potatoes are a crucial staple food globally, grown in 95 countries. However, around 32% of potato crops are annually lost due to diseases and pests. Among these, early blight and late blight pose significant threats.

Approach:
We're constructing three models - SVM, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The final output is obtained by stacking these models through training a logistic regression classifier.

Project Aim:
To train a machine learning model using a labeled dataset of potato leaf images for precise disease classification. Employing techniques like data augmentation enhances model performance and prevents overfitting. Post-training, the model can classify unseen potato leaf images into specific disease categories.

Data:
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains labeled potato leaf images annotated with respective disease categories. It encompasses various diseases like late blight and early blight.

Future Prospects:
Expanding the model's application to other plants is envisioned, promoting production efficiency and economic growth in agriculture. Additionally, AI-based applications utilizing cameras for easy disease identification in plants are in development.

We welcome your contributions and feedback! Let's collaborate to improve crop management and minimize economic losses in agriculture.
